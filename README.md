# Overview

A simple study tool can make a big difference for someone studying to get ready for a test. LearnStuff is a mobile app intended to create a simple way for students to memorize vocabulary using various activities.

To use the app, simply open it up and select one of the pre-existing vocab sets available. From there, select the activity you would like to use to study. Follow the directions and enjoy learning the material!

I decided to create this app, because I'd seen how useful Quizlet could be for studying, but didn't want to have to pay for the premium access in order to use the majority of the activities they provide. So I decided to make my own version!

UPDATE:
Now the app has been integrated with a firestore database so that the user can insert new vocab sets to study from, as well as editing and deleting those sets!

# Development Environment

I created this app using React Native in Visual Studio Code, with Expo CLI to test the app. I also used GitHub as my version control system. In addition, I used firebase 11.1.

# Future Work

* Add authentication so that users can have individual vocab sets
* Possibly add functionality for images to be used as terms to memorize
* Use Styles to make the app much more presentable and elegant
* Make an activity which puts all the previous activities together in one learning mode
