# Overview

A simple study tool can make a big difference for someone studying to get ready for a test. LearnStuff is a mobile app intended to create a simple way for students to memorize vocabulary using various activities.

To use the app, simply open it up and select one of the pre-existing vocab sets available. From there, select the activity you would like to use to study. Follow the directions and enjoy learning the material!

I decided to create this app, because I'd seen how useful Quizlet could be for studying, but didn't want to have to pay for the premium access in order to use the majority of the activities they provide. So I decided to make my own version!

# Development Environment

I created this app using React Native in Visual Studio Code, with Expo CLI to test the app. I also used GitHub as my version control system

# Future Work

* Implement cloud database for entering in of new vocab sets
* Use Styles to make the app much more presentable and elegant
* Make an activity which puts all the previous activities together in one learning mode
